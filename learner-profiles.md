This course is suitable for any researcher or research student who would like to upskill in reproducible research practices.

Due to the number of other RR courses focusing on computational research, this workshop takes a step back to focus more on practices that both non-computational and computational researchers can use. While we aim to cover all disciplines, the authors acknowledge that reproducibility may not fit in some areas of research.

This course is not aimed taking your from 0-100 in Reproducible Research - it instead aims to help you further down your RR path. You don't need to necessarily make all the changes suggested at once - instead, start with easy changes and come back once you feel comfortable and ready to take your next steps.
