<!-- Does your institute have a Reproducibility club, ReproducibiliTea group or webpages on reproducibility? This is where to include it. Also add any further follow up information you would like to share. -->



For each of our 7 lessons, do we have an action item?

Let’s establish concrete action items for the upcoming week or two based on the tasks we’ve just documented.

***Take this time to do one of the following:***

Email yourself a website you've found today to read through later.
