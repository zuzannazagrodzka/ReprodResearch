# Persistent Identifiers



## Identifiers vs Persistent Identifiers

### What is the difference?

***An identifier*** is any label used to name an item (whether digital or physical). URLs and serial numbers are an examples of digital identifiers. Personal names are also identifiers, but are not necessarily unique as you may share the same name with other researchers around the world.

Examples of identifiers:

URL: https://www.griffith.edu.au/eresearch-services/hacky-hour would direct to the correct website.... until the team got renamed during a restructure.

Barcode: 32888493 may work in a lab, however may not be unique outside a lab. Or the product making the barcode may be discontinued.



***A persistent identifier*** is long-lasting unique digital reference to a webpage, digital object, even a person.

 - DOI

 - ORCID

This video from [Research Data Netherlands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgqtiY7oZ6k) explains persistent identifiers and data citation.

Let's go into these in more detail.

#### Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) - Identify information

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are used to uniquely identify digital research objects, and provide a persistent link to the location of the object on the internet. They also enable citation and tracking of citation metrics.

A DOI is a unique alphanumeric string that identifies content and provides a persistent link to its location on the internet. Metadata for that object is collected, including attributions, and attached to a DOI. 

They are the global standard for digital scholarly publications. 

A DOI looks like this: https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/8v2n7

##### Minting DOI

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Include information around who mints DOIs at your organisation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 


<!-- Who do researchers talk to, to get a DOI minted? What other information around DOIs do you want to share? Include it below- you can delete the existing text. -->


Often, your institute library will mint a DOI for you.


Journal publishers assign DOIs to electronic versions of individual articles & datasets.

In addition, [Open Science Framework](https://help.osf.io/article/220-create-dois) can mint a DOI for your repository.


#### ORCID - Identify a person

ORCID [Open Researcher and Contributor ID](https://info.orcid.org/researchers/) provides a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that you own and control, and that distinguishes you from every other researcher. 

You can connect your ID with your professional information — affiliations, grants, publications, peer review, and more. You can use your ID to share your information with other systems, ensuring you get recognition for all your contributions, saving you time and hassle, and reducing the risk of errors.

An ORCID looks like https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0838-1771 .


This can assist people to find you :

- When you move across institutes

- If you have a common last name

- If you change your name



# Deposit your final data/analysis

Let's get your work deposited so that others may access it.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Unsure about publishing your data and pipelines publically?

Let's look at our options.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# Open vs FAIR vs Can't share

Firstly, if you can share your work openly - Great!


Learn more about the distinction between [open data, FAIR data and Research Data Management here.](https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.468). 
Considering why you should share your data? Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qsHFHHPrw0)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Does your institute have a policy, statement, procedure or resources on open access or publishing data and materials openly?

Link to them here.

You can also find examples of who has published openly in your institute.

Have you got an open network?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 


<!-- Include information about open access/publishing here. -->



Prior to sharing, ensure you have clearly defined the licence, IP and attribution attached to your work.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Link to your organisation's IP/Copyright person.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 


<!-- Who do researchers talk to for copyright and IP help? Got a website? -->


There are plenty of reasons you may not be able to share your data and pipelines openly. 

In these cases, you could consider making your data as FAIR as possible. 

This means you want to share the data, have it well described and have it in a good shape for sharing, but you can mediate requests and access. 

Mediation of access can include caveats such as the need for a Data Transfer Agreement, limitations according to the ethics and governance, or other controls. 

More information on [FAIR can be found here](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/)

## FAIR Data

![](episodes/fig/FAIRnessOfData.png){alt='FAIR as images'}


::: tab 


### Findable

The data has sufficiently rich metadata and a unique and persistent identifier to be easily discovered by others. This includes assigning a persistent identifier (like a DOI or Handle), having rich metadata to describe the data and making sure it is findable through disciplinary local or international discovery portals.


### Accessible

The data is retrievable by humans and machines through a standardised communication protocol, with authentication and authorisation where necessary. The data does not necessarily have to be open. Data can be sensitive due to privacy concerns, national security or commercial interests. When it’s not able to be open, there should be clarity and transparency around the conditions governing access and reuse.


### Interoperable

The associated data and metadata uses a ‘formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation’. This involves using community accepted languages, formats and vocabularies in the data and metadata. Metadata should reference and describe relationships to other data, metadata and information through identifiers.


### Reusable

The associated metadata provides rich and accurate information, and the data comes with a  clear usage licence and detailed provenance information. Reusable data should maintain its initial richness. For example, it should not be diminished for the purpose of explaining the findings in one particular publication. It needs a clear machine readable licence and provenance information on how the data was formed. It should also use discipline-specific data and metadata standards to give it rich contextual information that will allow reuse.

# Licensing

When publishing supplimentary data, or wanting to share code, analysis pipelines, any datasets or other grey outputs, it is incredibly important to attach a license.

A licences provides guidence and sets legal obligations on

- Who can reuse this material and for what?

- Can this be used commercially?

- No warranties are given or similar

- If someone uses your work as part of their project, are they obligated to also use the same license?

- Do they need to attribute your work?

Attribution especially is very important as it can help with redirecting people to your original work and builds your reputation. 

This [guide on licencing](https://help.osf.io/article/148-licensing) from OSF is a good place to start on what are the different types of licenses, what are the restrictions on each, how to license material such as preprints, registrations and projects and more.

Connect with your organisation's IP, Copyright and Commercialisation team for more assistance.

# Where to deposit?

Deposit final state data to support your publications in an
institutional or discipline data repository which can mint a DOI and
create a citation for your work.


<!-- Include information about your organisational data repository here. -->


[Here is a helpful guide to choosing a data repository](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/guide-to-choosing-a-data-repository/)

Some repositories include:

 - [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)

 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

 - [Re3Data](https://www.re3data.org/)

 - [PLOSone Recommended Repositories](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/recommended-repositories)

Can you also publish your raw data?



### Publishing negative results

While it can be disheartening to get negative results, these results are still beneficial to the research community at large. 

You worked out something ***didn't work***, __which is important knowledge all in itself__. Sharing this means others don't need to reinvent the wheel, saving research effort and time.

There are a number of journals that specialise in these results.

[Positively Negative](https://everyone.plos.org/2015/02/25/positively-negative-new-plos-one-collection-focusing-negative-null-inconclusive-results/)

[The Missing Pieces](https://collections.plos.org/collection/missing-pieces/)

[Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis](https://www.jasnh.com/)

[The All Results Journals](https://arjournals.com/)


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Information worth including in your paper or repository


 - Have limitations of the study been noted and justified/discussed?

 - Have you discussed how you handled missing data?

 - Should you include a reflective statement, with consideration on how your own bias/ priviledges/ world views may impact the findings?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## What if a collaborative relationship sours?

Imagine you have been working with a collaborative partner in a different organisation. As you finish your project, they state that they are no longer interested in working together and are going to apply for the next grant with another partner.

How will this affect you?

What steps have we taken so far to help protect our position?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

This may affect you 


However, we've already taken steps to protect ourselves and safeguard against any potential fallout.

We've documented our [ethics and governance](episodes/step4Doco.html) documents and have clarified the conditions around reuse of the data, whether the data can be shared and what the data can be used for.

We've licensed our pipelines and data to specify whether it can be reused or if it can be commercialised, and if we need to be cited.
